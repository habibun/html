    <div itemprop="reviewBody">I had an urge to mack on some pizza, and this
        place was the only joint around. It looked like a bit of a dive, but I went
        in hoping to find an undiscovered gem. Instead, I watched a Health
        Department inspector closing the place down. Verdict? I didn't get to
        finish my pizza, and the inspector recommends a Hep-C shot.
