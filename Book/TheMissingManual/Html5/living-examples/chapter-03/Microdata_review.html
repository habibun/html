  <p itemprop="summary">Pretty bad, and then the Health Department showed up.</p>
  <p itemprop="description">I had an urge to mack on some pizza, and this place
was the only joint around. It looked like a bit of a dive, but I went in hoping to
find an undiscovered gem. Instead, I watched a Health Department inspector closing
the place down. Verdict? I didn't get to finish my pizza, and the inspector
recommends a Hep-C shot.</p>
