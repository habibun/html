<p>Avoid losing floppy disks with important school/work projects on them. Use the web
    to keep your content so you can access it from anywhere in the world. It's also a quick
    way to write reminders or notes to yourself. With simple html skills, (the ones you have gained so far)it is easy.</p>

<p>For instance, let's say you had a HUGE school or work project to complete. Off hand,
    the easiest way to transfer the documents from your house could be a 3.5" floppy disk.
    However, there is an alternative. Place your documents, photos, essays, or videos onto
    your web server and access them from anywhere in the world. </p>
