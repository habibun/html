The <a> tag, or anchor tag, creates a hyperlink in a web page. 
When clicked, a hyperlink—or link—can lead anywhere on the web. 
You tell the browser where the link points by putting a web address inside the <a> tags. 
For instance, you might type <a href=“http://www.missingmanuals.com”>Click here!</a>. 
The browser knows that when your visitor clicks the words “Click here!” 
it should go to the Missing Manual website. 
The href part of the tag is called an at- tribute and the URL 
(the Uniform Resource Locator or web address) is the value. 
In this example, http://www.missingmanuals.com is the value of the href attribute.
